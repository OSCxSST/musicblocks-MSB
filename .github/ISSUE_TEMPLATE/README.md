## How to Use

1. **Creating an Issue**: When you create a new issue, GitHub will automatically show you a list of available templates
2. **Choose the Right Template**: Select the template that best matches your issue type
3. **Fill Out All Sections**: Complete all required fields and provide as much detail as possible
4. **Use Labels**: Templates automatically apply appropriate labels to help with organization

## Template Guidelines

### For Bug Reports
- Provide clear steps to reproduce the issue
- Include console errors and screenshots when applicable
- Specify your environment (OS, browser, device)
- Test on the latest version when possible

### For Feature Requests
- Clearly describe the problem you're trying to solve
- Provide user stories and use cases
- Consider implementation complexity
- Include mockups or design ideas when relevant

### For Documentation Issues
- Specify the exact location of the documentation problem
- Provide clear suggestions for improvement
- Consider your target audience

## Best Practices

1. **Search First**: Always search existing issues before creating a new one
2. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete examples and specific details
3. **Be Respectful**: Follow the project's code of conduct
4. **Follow Up**: Respond to questions and help test fixes
5. **Use Labels**: Let the templates apply appropriate labels automatically

## Configuration

The `config.yml` file configures the issue template system:
- Disables blank issues to encourage template usage
- Provides links to community resources
- Directs users to appropriate channels for different needs
