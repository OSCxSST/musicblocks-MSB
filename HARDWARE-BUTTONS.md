# Hardware Button Support for Music Blocks

Music Blocks now supports hardware button controls for navigating between musical sections (chunks) with smart fallback options. Use your Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, Sony, Bose), keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd + Arrow keys), or desktop app menus to skip forward/backward through your compositions. The system automatically detects musical "chunks" based on action blocks and start blocks, allowing you to skip between sections - when no chunks are available, it falls back to fast-forward/rewind within the current music. This works across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) through the Media Session API for browsers and Electron integration for desktop apps, providing seamless navigation through your musical creations with visual feedback for all actions.
